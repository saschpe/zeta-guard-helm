# Release Notes ZETA Guard Helm Charts

## Release 1.2.2

### changed:

- VAU related bugfixes
- fixed: Now enforcing client and dpop key binding in smc-b token

## Release 1.2.1

### changed:

- Update authserver to 1.2.2 with an important VAU related bugfix
  (Note: The authserver version is not a typo. In the 3rd digit release versions
  of the individual components of the helm chart may differ from the helm chart
  version.)

## Release 1.2.0

### migration:

- **Keycloak version bumps require a deployment cutover.** Plain`helm upgrade`
  hangs when the new Keycloak version ships a different JGroups protocol
  version; mixed-version pods can't form a cluster. Liquibase migrations and
  Infinispan cache serialization can also clash across minor versions. Run one
  of the following before/during the upgrade:

  ```sh
  kubectl -n <namespace> delete deployment authserver   # then helm upgrade as usual
  # OR
  helm upgrade --force ...                              # delete + recreate as part of the upgrade
  ```

  Not needed for deploys that don't change the Keycloak image tag (config
  tweaks, label changes, resource bumps).
  
  NOTE: Once installations are in production this kind of update will be avoided / flanked
  with measurements supporting availability.

### added:

- Added `include proxy_headers.conf;` to each `pep on;` location using
  `proxy_pass` in PEP
- New value `authserver.hsm.tokenSigning.failClosed` (default: `true`) — when
  HSM token signing is enabled, refuse software-key fallback if HSM is
  unreachable.
- configuration for application level db encryption (only for VAU based
  applications)
- New values `pepproxy.wellKnownResourceSuffix` (default: `/pep/`) and
  `authserver.wellKnownAuthServerPath` (default: `/`) make the path components
  of the `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` document configurable.
- Forward proxy support for all ZETA Guard components
    - Env vars set in all affected pods: `HTTP_PROXY`, `http_proxy`,
      `HTTPS_PROXY`, `https_proxy`, `NO_PROXY`, `no_proxy`, `ALL_PROXY`,
      `all_proxy`.
    - PEP (nginx): proxy vars propagated to worker processes via `env`
      directives in `nginx.conf`, picked up by the `reqwest` HTTP client at
      worker init.
- Enabled SIEM telemetry delivery to gematik by default
- Enabled metrics delivery to gematik
- Filter telemetry sent to gematik (incl. SIEM).
    - Drop all logs except logs about authorization server, HTTP proxy, policy
      engine, and resource server.
    - Drop all metrics about zeta-guard components.
    - Drop all spans except for HTTP server spans about requests to public
      endpoints of authorization server, HTTP proxy, policy engine, and resource
      server.

### changed:

- Scope name validation in the Terraform authserver config (`pdp_scopes` and
  `audience_scope_name`) now allows periods (`.`).
- Updated OpenTelemetry collector to version 0.153.0.
- The terraform config step now removes all RSA key providers from the
  `zeta-guard` realm.
  Only ECC keys (ES256 / P-256) remain in the JWKS endpoint
  (`/auth/realms/zeta-guard/protocol/openid-connect/certs`). RSA keys that
  Keycloak creates automatically on realm initialization (e.g.
  `rsa-enc-generated`) are deleted unconditionally as part of every Terraform
  run.
- Copy OpenTelemetry attribute `http.status_code` to
  `http.response.status_code`. This is a workaround to fulfill A_27725 required
  until PEP adheres to OpenTelemetry semantic conventions 1.41.
- some APIs of the authserver now conform with gemSpec_ZETA 1.3.0 better but
  break compatibility with the client SDK 1.0.x . This affects OCSP for SMC-Bs
  audiences and some expected token content among other things (See
  keycloak-zeta release notes for more info)

### removed:

- `authserver.provider.smcB.opa.enabled`, `…opa.failClosed`, and chart-root
  `opa.enabled` — OPA enforcement is now mandatory and always fail-closed.
  **Migration**: stale toggle values in override files are silently ignored
  after upgrade — OPA will start unconditionally and return
  `503 temporarily_unavailable` when unreachable. Remove the keys from values to
  avoid confusion.

### known issues:

- TLS termination directly at the authserver and PEP does not yet fully conform
  to the spec. Therefore, this feature is *NOT PRODUCTION READY* yet.
  Termination at the ingress controller works as specified and is production
  ready.
- The authserver returns incorrect HTTP status codes for some denied tokens
  (some even return 500). These cases have been investigated, and no negative
  security implications have been identified. Some fixes for these issues depend
  on upstream pull requests.
- Expired clients are not automatically deleted yet. Additionally, clients are
  not removed when the maximum client limit per Telematik ID is reached.
- Request processing by the authserver may be slow under load. Remediation
  appears to be possible with a more powerful database (more memory, CPU, and
  connections).
- OCSP during token exchange does not yet support revoked issuer CAs and does
  not enforce the same TSP for the OCSP signer and the certificate issuer.
- Token signature keys do not yet support automatic rotation.
- Some PEP response codes for denied requests do not match the specification.
- Impossible/no travel is detected (and denied), but sessions are not
  invalidated.
- Telemetry delivery to gematik has some limitations regarding the exact fields
  that are delivered. Delivery from the resource server is passed on correctly,
  however.
- Some security KPIs are missing.
- Caching, ETags, etc., do not work yet.
- Rate limiting can be configured and works. However, communication to the
  client via headers does not work yet.


## Release 1.0.1

### added:

- configuration for application level db encryption (only for VAU based
  applications)

### changed:

- When using ASL `pepproxy.nginxConf.locations` are now by default not public
  anymore (nginx directive `deny all;`). This makes misconfiguration harder. In
  case there are locations that should be reachable without using ASL, you will
  now need to add `satisfy all; allow all;` to that location for it to be
  reachable. Make sure this is permitted by your spec.
- session affinity is cookie-based now (zeta-route), instead of relying on
  x-forwarded-for header from downstream

### removed

- `zeta-guard.sessionAffinity`, it is always enabled now (NIC)

## Release 1.0.0

### added:

- Egress NetworkPolicies (`networkPolicy.enabled`, default: `false`). When
  enabled, each ZETA
  Guard pod gets a `NetworkPolicy` (egress-only) that restricts outbound traffic
  to explicitly configured IP blocks.
- hsmsim: Allow mounting certs from secret, remove persistent mode (unused)
- ingress: Add `zeta-guard.nginxIngressHsm`. If true (and
  `zeta-guard.nginxIngressEnabled`),
  don't define `tls` on master ingress. This allows to use the ossl_hsm provider
  (controller image `ngx_pep/nginx-ingress` contains it), and inject custom TLS
  configuration.
- Keycloak Admin REST API protection via a dedicated admin hostname
  (`authserver.adminHostname`). When set:
    - The NGINX PEP proxy blocks `GET /auth/admin/*` on the main hostname with
      `403 Forbidden`, without any ingress-controller-specific annotations.
      Works with F5 NIC, standard nginx-ingress, OpenShift Routes, GKE Ingress,
      and others.
    - A separate `zeta-guard-admin` (master) + `zeta-guard-admin-minion` Ingress
      pair is created for the admin hostname, routing `/auth` directly to the
      authserver (no PEP token required).
        - The `/auth` path entry is removed from the main-hostname minion
          ingress;
          `/auth` reaches the PEP proxy via the existing `/` catch-all.
        - Keycloak's `--hostname-admin` flag is set automatically, keeping the
          Admin
          Console reachable exclusively via the admin hostname.
- New Terraform variable `audience` (default `""`). When non-empty, overrides
  the audience value embedded in access tokens by the audience mapper. Required
  when
  `keycloak_url` points to a separate admin hostname (so the audience stays tied
  to the main public hostname, not the admin hostname).
- `zeta-guard.pepproxy.nginxConf.poppValidity` to configure PoPP validity (fixed
  duration since iat or "quarter" mode — valid within current quarter)
- New value `provisioningProcessor.provisioningContainerCaSecretRef` to provide
  the CA certificate of the provisioning container registry as a Kubernetes
  Secret reference (mounted as a file). This avoids the kernel `ARG_MAX` limit
  that can be hit when passing large certificate chains as environment
  variables.
- New value `provisioningProcessor.provisioningContainer` to configure a custom
  registry mirror for the provisioning data image.
- New Terraform variable `audience_scope_name` (default `"zero:audience"`) to
  allow renaming the audience scope for environments that use a different scope
  naming convention. Set in the stage tfvars file:
  ```hcl
  audience_scope_name = "custom:audience"
  ```
- Dedicated ServiceAccount (`automountServiceAccountToken: false`) for
  authserver, PEP-Proxy, infinispan-external, exauthsim, test-driver, and
  tiger-proxy
- PodDisruptionBudget (disabled by default) for authserver,
  infinispan-external, exauthsim, test-driver, and tiger-proxy
- Configurable pod and container security contexts for all workloads; defaults
  include `seccompProfile: RuntimeDefault` and least-privilege container
  settings
- Configurable resources for authserver keycloak-build init container
  (`authserver.initContainer.resources`)
- Configurable probe thresholds for authserver liveness, readiness, and startup
  probes (`authserver.probes`)
- Configurable CloudNativePG database connection (`cloudnativeDbUrl`,
  `cloudnativeDbSecretName`, `cloudnativeDbSchema`)
- Configurable container security context for HSM-Sim and authserver HSM
- HSM-backed JWT token signing (`authserver.hsm.tokenSigning.enabled/keyId`) —
  access, ID, and refresh tokens signed with ES256 via HSM
- Terraform automation for HSM KeyProvider registration and software signing key
  cleanup. New tfvars to enable and configure HSM-backed token signing
- HSM status displayed in Helm NOTES output (hsm, hsm-tls, hsm-token-sign)
- Values schema (`values.schema.json`) extended with reusable `$defs` for
  `K8sServiceAccount`, `K8sPodDisruptionBudget`, and `K8sPodSecurityContext`
- Rename value of audience claim used in generateIdToken renamed from
  `zeta-guard.gematik.clientId` to `zeta-guard.gematik.IdTokenAudience`
- The Authserver (Keycloak) will export its logs to telemetry-gateway
- PDP (OPA) will export its decision logs and status updates to
  telemetry-gateway
- OPA simulation will export its decision logs and status updates to
  telemetry-gateway
- PEP (nginx) will export its logs to telemetry-gateway

### changed:

- Authserver container resources moved from `authserver.resources` to
  `authserver.container.resources`
- Removed erroneous pod-level `resources` blocks in authserver and PEP-Proxy
  deployments (were rendered twice)
- Authserver KC_DB_URL in cloudnative mode is no longer hardcoded
- Infinispan-external: image and container security context are now configurable
  (previously hardcoded)
- Tiger-proxy nginx sidecar: image template aligned with popp-mocks (supports
  optional registry prefix), `imagePullPolicy` added
- opa image is now configurable in the same way as all the other images
- `main.tf` and `providers.tf` are now generated dynamically from templates
  and gitignored; the backend block and Kubernetes provider are selected based
  on `use_kubernetes`. When `use_kubernetes = false`, neither the
  `hashicorp/kubernetes` required provider nor the `provider "kubernetes"`
  block are emitted, so Terraform no longer requires the Kubernetes provider
  in local/non-cluster mode.
- Updated OpenTelemetry collector to version 0.151.0.
- Authserver (Keycloak) will export traces as intended
- PDP (OPA) will export traces regardless of policy source
- Ingress TLS hardened to ECDSA-only: cert-manager now issues ECDSA P-256
  certificates for the master ingress (`cert-manager.io/private-key-algorithm:
  ECDSA`, `private-key-size: 256`); RSA cipher suites removed from
  `ssl-ciphers` and `@SECLEVEL=3` enforced; `brainpoolP512r1` added to
  `ssl-ecdh-curve`
- New value `nginx-ingress.controller.pod.annotations.config-rev` to force a
  NIC pod restart on TLS/HSM config changes (see
  `docs/how-to_guides/How_to_configure_Ingress.md`).

## Release 0.5.3

### changed:

- authserver 0.5.1
- hsm_sim 0.5.0

## Release 0.5.2

### added:

- authserver hsm support (TLS)
- upgrade cert-manager v1.20.1
- hsm_sim 0.5.0 disabled by default

## Release 0.5.1

### added:

- pep hsm support (TLS)

## Release 0.5.0

### added:

- Description and examples for more or less all values in
  `charts/zeta-guard/values.schema.json`
- Support configuration of OCSP stapling for ASL
- Option to enable or disable no-travel enforcement
- Option to deploy hsm proxy simulator for the test setup
- Provisioning Processor (run in sidecars) that downloads the provisioning
  container from gematik and derives the trust anchors from it.
- Terraform configuration now supports Kubernetes and local operating modes. Set
  `use_kubernetes = true` (default) to store state in a K8s Secret and fetch
  credentials from the cluster, or `use_kubernetes = false` to use a local state
  file and explicit credentials.
  See [How to configure authserver](docs/how-to_guides/How_to_configure_authserver.md).
- Terraform variable validations for `keycloak_namespace`, `keycloak_url`,
  `pdp_scopes`, and a cross-variable check that credentials are provided in
  local mode

### changed:

- Replaced OpenShift Route (`openshiftRoute`) with Ingress-based TLS support (
  `openshiftIngress`). The custom `openshift-route.yaml` template has been
  removed. Migrate from `openshiftRoute.enabled` / `openshiftRoute.host` /
  `openshiftRoute.issuer` to `openshiftIngress.enabled` +
  `openshiftIngress.certName`. This works with OpenShift's Ingress-to-Route
  controller and creates edge-terminated routes with TLS redirect.
- Testdriver ingress is now configurable: added `ingressEnabled`,
  `nginxIngressEnabled`, and `openshiftIngress` toggles to the testdriver
  subchart.
- Fixed configuration of telemetry-collector in `local-test/values.local.yaml`.
- Fixed erroneous TLS configuration for telemetry-gateway.
- You can now provide your own secrets to the zeta-guard sub chart instead of
  having them created.
- Make it optional for the chart to deploy secrets. It's now possible to
  reference existing secrets.
- `managePolicies.sh` now uses the Keycloak REST API (`curl`+`jq`) instead of
  `kubectl exec` + `kcadm.sh` into the Keycloak pod. No Java or Keycloak CLI
  installation required.
- `main.tf` is now generated dynamically from templates and gitignored; the
  backend block is selected based on `use_kubernetes`
- Keycloak admin username and password are resolved dynamically in both the
  Terraform provider and the policy management script
- `keycloak_password` and `keycloak_username` are now both marked `sensitive` in
  Terraform variables
- Keycloak provider version constraint updated to `>= 5.7.0`
- Updated OpenTelemetry collector to version 0.149.0.

## Release 0.4.1

### added:

- Configurable authserver DB connection pool and HTTP thread pool
- Configurable resource limits and requests

### changed:

- Updated OPA and NGINX-Ingress

### removed:

- Removed log-collector component

## Release 0.4.0

### added:

- Support for container image digests in compound `image` values
- Support for custom affinities, labels, pod annotations, and tolerances
- Support for individual security context per pod
- Support for OpenShift compatibility
- OPA simulation support
- Enabled telemetry delivery to gematik by default
- Configurable replica counts
- PEP sticky sessions for multi-replica deployments
- Support for external Infinispan

### changed:

- `GENESIS_HASH` and `SMCB_HASHING_PEPPER` are now provided exclusively via
  Kubernetes Secrets and are no longer configured directly in the template file.
  These values must be present in the respective values.yaml during the initial
  deployment; for upgrades, existing Secrets are retained.
- For external database configurations, both the Keycloak database username and
  password are now expected as keys within the same Kubernetes Secret (
  `authserverDb.kcDbSecretName`).
- Charts have been tested with RedHats local OpenShift testplatform, CodeReady
  Containers (CRC) with standard pod security `restricted-v2`.
- It is now possible to set the `securityContext` on a per-pod basis via Helm
  values.
- Support for lists of image pull secrets and aligned values with Kubernetes
  syntax
- Database modes: only `cloudnative` (CloudNativePG) and `external` are
  supported. Use a single cluster-wide CloudNativePG operator.
- `opa.image` is now a string value instead of a compound value.
- Container images of CronJobs and nginx-prometheus-exporter are now
  configurable.
- Aligned values for image pull policies with Kubernetes syntax.
- Updated OpenTelemetry collector to version 0.147.0.
- Updated OpenPolicyAgent to version 1.14.0-static.
- **BREAKING CHANGE** Pod selectors now use Kubernetes' well-known labels
- Configurable smc-b keystore
- The chart's Ingresses have become optional, and you can configure their
  annotations.
- `nginx-ingress.enabled` has been replaced by `nginxIngressEnabled`.
- k8sattributes processor deactivated for log-collector and telemetry-gateway
- Restricted log collection to OPA pods and containers.

### removed:

- Support for Bitnami PostgreSQL subchart removed.
- Support for Zalando Postgres Operator removed (`databaseMode: operator` no
  longer available).
- Unused value `global.registry`
- Labels containing container image tags

## Release 0.3.2

### changed

- authserver-version

## Release 0.3.1

### added

- websocket support

## Release 0.3.0

### added:

- added support for postgres operator by documentation and makefile; also in
  local test setup
- telemetry-gateway can redact known kinds of secrets and personal information
  from logs, metrics, and traces
- Mergeable Ingress (F5 NIC: master + minions)

### changed:

- Helm 4 required; Kubernetes >= 1.25;
- TLS defaults hardened (protocols, ciphers, HSTS)
- **BREAKING CHANGE**. We changed the ingress to F5 nginx-ingress NIC
  mergeable (master + minions).
  If you were using the original community ingress-nginx from the ZETA umbrella
  chart,
  delete the cluster-scoped IngressClass and ValidatingWebhookConfiguration, and
  remove the
  associated Deployment/Services/Lease in your target namespace before deploying
  the new
  version. For example (replace NAMESPACE and STAGE):
  ```shell
  # cluster-scoped admission webhook (community ingress-nginx)
  kubectl delete validatingwebhookconfiguration zeta-testenv-STAGE-ingress-nginx-admission --ignore-not-found

  # namespaced community controller objects
  kubectl -n NAMESPACE delete deploy zeta-testenv-STAGE-ingress-nginx-controller --ignore-not-found
  kubectl -n NAMESPACE delete svc zeta-testenv-STAGE-ingress-nginx-controller --ignore-not-found
  kubectl -n NAMESPACE delete svc zeta-testenv-STAGE-ingress-nginx-controller-admission --ignore-not-found
  kubectl -n NAMESPACE delete lease zeta-testenv-STAGE-ingress-nginx-leader --ignore-not-found

  # cluster-scoped IngressClass used by the old controller
  kubectl delete ingressclass nginx-STAGE --ignore-not-found
  ```
  If Helm fails with lease ownership/validation errors during upgrade:
    - Adopt the existing Lease into the release:
      ```shell
      kubectl -n NAMESPACE annotate lease zeta-testenv-STAGE-nginx-ingress-leader-election meta.helm.sh/release-name=zeta-testenv-STAGE --overwrite
      kubectl -n NAMESPACE annotate lease zeta-testenv-STAGE-nginx-ingress-leader-election meta.helm.sh/release-namespace=NAMESPACE --overwrite
      kubectl -n NAMESPACE label lease zeta-testenv-STAGE-nginx-ingress-leader-election app.kubernetes.io/managed-by=Helm --overwrite
      ```
    - Or delete the Lease and redeploy:
      ```shell
      kubectl -n NAMESPACE delete lease zeta-testenv-STAGE-nginx-ingress-leader-election
      ```

  Notes:
    - Stray community ingress-nginx ValidatingWebhookConfigurations from other
      environments can block Ingress
      applies cluster-wide if their admission Service has no endpoints. Remove
      unused
      `*-ingress-nginx-admission` webhooks (or temporarily set
      `failurePolicy: Ignore`) before deploying.
    - hardened security context for all components

## Release 0.2.8

### changed:

- authserver and testdriver/exauthsim now have separate keystores/truststores.
  This chart now includes an RU based truststore for the authserver. For the
  testdriver/exauthsim you still need to bring your own cert&key.
- The values for the SMCB keystore have changed slightly. Now they are
  `smcb_keystore.keystore` and `smcb_keystore.password` with the same semantics.
  No changes are needed when using the makefile for the test setup.

## Release 0.2.7

### added:

- ability to configure external DBs. See helm values authserverDb.* in
  zeta-guard subchart
- improvements for better compliance with some kubernetes security policies

### changed:

- Makefile: streamlined stage/namespace/values selection; safer templating;
  clearer help
- Enforce admin-password of Authserver on initial deployment

## Release 0.2.6

### added:

- config for ASL test mode
- improved Betriebsdatenlieferung

### changed:

- updated versions of several subcomponents

## Release 0.2.5

### changed:

- fix missing opa service account
- fix popp token config

## Release 0.2.4

### added:

- missing file(s) for local deployments

### changed:

- minor doc improvements
- updated individual components to their newes versions
- functional userdata and clientdata headers (beware clientdata schema is still
  subject to change)

  exchange
- public release of test setup

## Release 0.1.3

### added:

- Helm chart for the prototype of ZETA Guard added
